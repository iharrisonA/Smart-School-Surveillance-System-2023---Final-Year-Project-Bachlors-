🏫 Smart School Surveillance System (SSSS)
A full-stack web-based school management system developed as a Final Year Project (FYP), built with ASP.NET Core MVC, C#, and SQL Server. The system replaces traditional paper-based school administration with a modern, role-based digital platform covering all core school operations.

📌 About the Project
SSSS provides three dedicated portals for Admin, Teacher, and Student roles, each with tailored functionality. The system handles everything from student and teacher management to attendance tracking, academic marks, fee voucher generation, leave applications, and a built-in Q&A system between students and teachers.

🚀 Key Features
Admin Portal — Manage students, teachers, classes, and subjects. Assign subjects to teachers, generate and track fee vouchers, review leave applications, and monitor announcements across the school.
Teacher Portal — Mark daily attendance, enter student marks by exam type, upload lecture materials, post announcements, and answer student questions.
Student Portal — View personal attendance records and marks, download study materials, check fee vouchers, submit leave applications, and ask subject-related questions.
